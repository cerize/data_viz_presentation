```{r}

library(gapminder)
```

All inspired heavily by [Tamara Munzner](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/), and also by the design of [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/), an R package for data visualization.

## Whence data visualization??

### Data abstraction: building the graph from the properties/constraints of the data

Two components:

* Mapping the variables in the data onto the aesthetic properties of the visualization
  * e.g. x-coordinate, y-coordinate, color, transparency, size...
* Defining the geometric objects that will represent each row of data.
  * e.g. point, bar, line...

### Task abstraction: building the graph from the properties/constraints of the viewer

* Deciding what the viewer's tasks are.
  * comparing, ranking, viewing relationships, viewing distributions, finding outliers... 
* Accounting for the viewer's perceptual abilities.
  * noticing differences in length, width, area, position, color, angle...
